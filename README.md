Demo of AutoComplete feature


The following is the demostration of Intellisense, online service deployed at Hackerrank that returns smart autocomplete results (similar to Eclipse IDE) for various programming languages. The server has a load balancer and can handle heavy load easily.

Anyone can send request to the servers at Hackerrank and get the autocomplete results for their code.

Their is a particular format in which the request has to be sent to the servers. The format of request should be clear from the demo code.
